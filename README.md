# Clean Uninstall HorizonXI
This script will perform a "clean" uninstall of the HorizonXI game installation and launcher. This may be useful in the event that you mess up your install somehow and run into issues reinstalling.

## Security Warnings
Downloading PowerShell scripts from the Internet can be dangerous so Windows often prevents you from running them on your machine. To unblock this script, open PowerShell, navigate to the directory with your script and run the following command:

`Unblock-File CleanUninstallHorizonXI.ps1`

You should now be able to run the script.
